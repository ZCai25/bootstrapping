# Project Title

A bootstrapping demo created by USF MSDS students Connor MacMillan, Joren Libunao, and Zemin Cai


## Description

This project is the demo for bootstrapping by resampling the salary data from Kaggle. It is created by Connor MacMillan, Joren Libunao, and Zemin Cai. After resample from the original, we calculate the population statistics (mean and median) and the confidence intervals. It also introduce us to the other advance topic like random forest or bagging.


## Getting Started
To start the project, you can clone or download the Jupyter Notebook file 'Bootstrapping_Demo.ipynb' and the ‘Salary_Data.csv’ to your local repository.The data is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohankayan/years-of-experience-and-salary-dataset.

### Dependencies

We use jupyter notebook, python version 3.9.12 and python packages like numpy, random, pandas to create the resampling process and matplotlib to visualize the results.

### Installing

Open terminal on your computer, pip install numpy, random, pandas and matplotlib into your machine. 

### Executing program
Open the Bootstrapping_Demo.ipynb using Juypyter Notebook. Import all the packages from the first cell in the Jupyter notebook and run all the code locally.
